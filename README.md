# ERC-Summer-Assignment-2020

The questions concerning arduino will be in the electronics folder. I made a seperate documentation for i2c communication only, for the rest I commented them in the arduino ide itself.

The questions concerning ROS will be in the automation and control folder. 

And you can find the cartpole question in RL folder. I watched all the related playlist from the youtube channel deeplizard. And I used their snippets for this question.
