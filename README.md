# ERC-Summer-Assignment-2020

The questions concerning arduino will be in the electronics folder. I made a seperate documentation for i2c communication only, for the rest I commented them in the arduino ide itself. Since in the q2, tinkercad dosent offer 3 digit display but 1 digit so I tried to output the values one by one onto the screen.

The questions concerning ROS will be in the automation and control folder. 

And you can find the cartpole question in RL folder.
