I completed the ML and intermediate ML courses on kaggle but they were based on scikit learn and I was already versed with pytorch. But it was insightful on how networks are coded on a basic level.

I watched all the related playlist from the youtube channel deeplizard, namely (ML and DL fundamentals, RL-goal oriented intelligence and keras). And I used their snippets for this question. I did not understand the entirety of the commands used for cartpole but I was able to understand and deal with questions like fashion mnist,frozen lake, etc. 

Since I started working more on qstp for kratos I shifted gears and I did not go full-fledged on ML and RL as my primary focus is electronics, but I tried my best.
